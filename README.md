# 🕳️ NoteHole

> Where thoughts go to disappear.

NoteHole is a note-taking app I built from scratch while teaching myself React, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase.  
No fancy team, no tutorial copy-paste — just me trying to figure things out one bug at a time.

This project is a learning playground, a productivity tool, and a mildly chaotic brain dump — all rolled into one.

## 💡 What It Does

- Take notes (duh)
- Organize thoughts into sections (Tasks, Ideas, Thoughts)
- Syncs with Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Realtime vibes)
- Keyboard shortcuts, fuzzy search, dark mode — the works
- Auth with Google, GitHub, Email/Password
- Fully responsive & built with love (and occasional frustration)

## 🧠 Why I Made This

I wanted to:
- Get better at React and state management (hello Zustand 👋)
- Learn how to actually build stuff with Supabase
- Make a personal notes app that doesn't feel like a corporate SaaS clone

This is not a clone. It's **NoteHole**. You've been warned.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Supabase (DB + Auth + Storage)
- Zustand
- Fuse.js (for fuzzy search)
- Vite
- Maybe some 💀 spaghetti logic I'll fix later

## 🔐 Client-Side Encryption

BrainDump now includes **client-side encryption** for all your data:

- **End-to-end encryption**: Your ideas, thoughts, and tasks are encrypted before being stored
- **User-specific keys**: Each user gets a unique encryption key derived from their credentials
- **Guest user support**: Anonymous users get secure encryption keys for local storage
- **Zero-knowledge**: Even the server can't read your encrypted data
- **Backward compatible**: Works with existing data and guest users

### How it works:

#### For Authenticated Users:
1. When you log in, a unique encryption key is generated from your user ID, email, and salt
2. All data is encrypted with AES-256-GCM before being sent to Supabase
3. Data is also encrypted in localStorage for offline use
4. Keys are stored locally and cleared on logout

#### For Guest Users:
1. Anonymous users get a randomly generated encryption key stored in localStorage
2. All guest data is encrypted locally but cannot sync with Supabase
3. Guest keys are cleared when the user logs out or clears browser data
4. Each guest session gets a unique encryption key

### Security Features:
- **AES-256-GCM encryption** for strong security
- **Unique keys per user** - no key sharing between users
- **Salt-based key derivation** for additional entropy
- **Session isolation** - keys cleared on logout
- **Guest encryption** - even anonymous users get encrypted storage


## 🚧 Disclaimer

This whole project is a WIP. Expect bugs, weird UI behavior, and maybe a few `console.log("why u no work")` lying around.

But hey — it works. Kinda.

Big thanks to the homie who helped with SEO audits and crafted the whole client-side encryption strategy. You know who you are. 🔐🫡
